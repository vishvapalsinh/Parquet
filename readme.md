# Parquet Data Processing Examples

This repository contains examples of working with Parquet files using Python and the `pandas` library. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that offers several advantages for big data processing and analytics. This repository demonstrates various tasks that can be performed with Parquet files, showcasing their importance in data processing workflows.

## Why Parquet?

Parquet offers the following advantages:

- **Columnar Storage**: Parquet organizes data by column, resulting in efficient compression and better query performance, especially when working with large datasets.
- **Schema Evolution**: Parquet supports schema evolution, allowing for schema changes over time without requiring modification of the entire dataset.
- **Compatibility**: Parquet is designed to be compatible with a variety of data processing frameworks, including Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, and Apache Arrow.
- **Compression**: Parquet provides various compression options, allowing for significant reduction in storage requirements and faster data access.
- **Predicates Pushdown**: Parquet supports predicate pushdown, which means that filtering can be pushed down to the storage layer, reducing the amount of data read during queries.

## Tasks Implemented

This repository demonstrates the following tasks with Parquet files:

1. **Reading and Displaying Parquet Data**: Shows how to read Parquet files into `pandas` DataFrames and display the contents.
2. **Writing Data to Parquet Files**: Illustrates how to create DataFrames with sample data and save them as Parquet files.
3. **Converting Data Formats**: Covers the conversion of data between Parquet and other formats like CSV.
4. **Merging or Appending Parquet Files**: Demonstrates how to merge or append multiple Parquet files into a single file.
5. **Performing Data Analysis and Transformations**: Highlights data analysis and transformation capabilities using Parquet files.
6. **Querying and Filtering Parquet Data**: Shows how to perform queries and apply filters on Parquet data.

Feel free to explore each task in its respective directory and refer to the individual documentation for detailed instructions.
